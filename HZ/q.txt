Houzz store time is a little more than other parents, began to ask some resume-related projects, the details of the implementation of the project are very detailed. The coding problem is to implement an iterator, which requires two functions, one init(), one product set, one next(), each call next() will output the elements in the next set, the product set is generated A string of characters, {abc, d, ef}, each time one of them, generate various combinations, such as ade, adf, bde, bdf... I wanted to use dfs to generate a set, then output According to this idea, I wrote a basic function. The input string entered by the interviewer will be very large, and may not be able to save so many results at once. Ask if there is any way to operate the stream. The way I think is to set a global counter and so on. A few, call next () when the result is generated, the result of the set size to counter + 1, is the next need to output when the stop, do not save the results, check what is output, the interviewer said this is too time-consuming, I think Time and space sometimes have trade off, and I don't think of a better solution. Finally, the interviewer suggested that I set a pointer for each string, and then a pointer to a pointer to go, so that the product set is generated. In fact, there is no difference between this time and dfs, but there is no time to discuss it. I think he might want to say k way. Merge and the like?
