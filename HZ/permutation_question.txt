// Given multiple lists, each list contains few integer numbers
// We want to get all the possible combinations within those lists, with the following condition:
// *** one combination should contain one and at MOST one element from each list ***

// Example: input => [[1,2], [3,4]]
// output = [[1, 3], [1, 4], [2, 3], [2, 4]] // 8
